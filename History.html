                                The history of HTTP dates back all the way to 1991, where Tim Berners-Lee, alongside his colleagues, developed what was initially 
                                meant to be a simple protocol for sharing files, but later evolved into what we use for everyday queries.

                                Starting in 1989, English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, whilst under the employment of European Organization 
                                for Nuclear Research (CERN), wrote a proposal to build a hypertext system over the World Wide Web, implemented in 1990. 
                                The initial development was supposed to be a simple protocol to exchange documents. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The one-line protocol, known as HTTP/0.9, consisted of a one-line request starting using the GET method. 
                                The response was also just as simple, displaying just the file requested. It was extremely basic, with no 
                                status or error codes, only HTML files were allowed, and errors would generate an HTML file describing the problem.

                                In 1996, HTTP/1.0 was introduced, which added more features to the protocol, such as status codes, headers, and the ability to handle 
                                different types of content. This version also allowed for persistent connections, meaning that multiple requests could be sent over a single 
                                connection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               To add onto the complexity of the newer HTTP/1.0, the concept of HTTP headers in requests and responses would introduce 
                               the transmission of metadata. This would include User-Agent, Host, Content-Type, Content-Length, and Cache-Control.

                                In 1999, HTTP/1.1 was introduced, which added support for persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and additional caching 
                                mechanisms. This version also introduced the concept of virtual hosting, allowing multiple websites to be hosted on a single server.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The rise of dynamic content, such as web applications and interactive websites, led to the need for more efficient communication 
                                between clients and servers. HTTP/1.1 addressed these needs by introducing features like pipelining and improved caching mechanisms.

                                In 2015, HTTP/2 was introduced, which focused on improving performance and reducing latency. It introduced features like 
                                multiplexing, header compression, and server push, allowing multiple requests to be sent over a single connection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The introduction of HTTP/2 marked a significant shift in how web content is delivered, 
                                with a focus on optimizing performance and reducing the overhead of HTTP communication.
