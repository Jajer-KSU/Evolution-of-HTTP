                                HTTP, known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, forms the base for what the World Wide Web was built upon. 
                                Anytime someone tries to search the World Wide Web, HTTP is used to load said webpages using what is 
                                called hypertext links.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                HTTP was designed at the application layer protocol of the internet protocol 
                                suite. According to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230.html">RFC 7230</a>, Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a stateless application-level request/response 
                                protocol that functions by the swapping of messages across a reliable connection <a href="References.html">(Fielding & Reschke, 1970).</a>
                                As just mentioned, HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that it does not maintain any memory of previous 
                                connections because each request is managed independently from one another.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To put the process of an HTTP interaction into better understanding, we can imagine a client (usually a browser) 
                                searching for something on the WWW, the HTTP request is sent to the server, and the server responds back with 
                                an HTTP response which displays the results of the query <a href="References.html"> (What is HTTP? | cloudflare).</a>
